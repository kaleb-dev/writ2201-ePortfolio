      <p class="mb-6">The Ryobi JM82K Biscuit Joiner is part of Ryobi's line of affordable woodworking tools designed for DIY enthusiasts and hobbyists. Released in 2011, this tool fills the need for precise joinery work without the high cost of professional-grade equipment. The biscuit joiner uses compressed wood biscuits and glue to create strong, aligned joints between wood pieces.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">The Ryobi JM82K Biscuit Joiner (2011) is small, corded, green, and black, similar to other Ryobi power tools. The metal front plate fence system, black handle that is easy to grip, and dust collection port to hook up a dust bag describe it. The cutting blade is in the front, and there is a rack-and-pinion fence that is easily adjusted for position and height.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-8">
        <li><strong>Fence Misalignment:</strong> Over time, the rack-and-pinion fence system can become loose or misaligned, leading to inaccurate biscuit slot placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Blade Dulling or Chipping:</strong> The 4-inch 8-tooth carbide-tipped blade wears down after extended use, causing rough or incomplete cuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Motor Burnout:</strong> Reported after extended use, especially when the tool is used for materials beyond its capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Switch Failures:</strong> The power switch can become unreliable or completely fail after prolonged use.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
      <div class="border rounded-lg p-6 mb-8 bg-gray-50">
        <p class="mb-4">If your Ryobi JM82K is not cutting to the proper depth, first check that the depth adjustment knob is set correctly. If the setting appears correct, inspect the blade for wear or damage. Dull or chipped blades will not cut effectively and should be replaced. Also verify that the fence is properly aligned and locked in position before making cuts.</p>
        <p>For motor issues, ensure the power source is functioning correctly and check the power cord for damage. If the motor runs but lacks power, the carbon brushes may need replacement. For fence alignment problems, clean the rack-and-pinion system and adjust according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p>
